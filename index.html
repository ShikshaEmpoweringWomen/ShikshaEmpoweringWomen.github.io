				Project SHIKSHA ‘empowering women’ stands to remove the myths associated with the women and aspires to provide them means and ways to protect themselves from all forms of wrongdoing and sidelining. Education is the cardinal and foremost tool by which women in underdeveloped areas can be empowered and taught to live life independently with respect. <br>

Women have become an object of endurance in this era for they are forced to bear the wrath of ruthless, heinous acts that surround them. Every year contrary to the booming economic development across the globe, the condition of women is simply deteriorating that too at an unpleasant rate. Project SHIKSHA ‘empowering women’ was started with the aim to bring change in the life of women by teaching them and motivating them for better a future. For ages they have been considered as just the backbone of a family, now it’s time that they hold their heads high and embrace the world having plenty of opportunities for their empowerment. <br> 

Today, even the World Bank has acknowledged that there is no investment more effective for achieving overall development goals than educating girls.

				<p style="font-size:14px;">
					It was time that we started materialising our brainchild. The first step was to convince the parents of all the girls in our target villages. We decided to visit villages in Farrukhabad district of Uttar Pradesh. Our main aim was to make them realise the importance of education and how it can remarkably affect the lives of all the girls we intended to educate.

					We started our classroom programme with two volunteers- Jenya Krivlop from Ukraine and Ildar Muzafraov from Moscow, Russia. Our main focus was on personality development and working on English speaking and writing skills of the girls. In the first class, we managed to get only six girls. But within a week, the count increased to 107. The girls were generally between 6-18 years of age.
